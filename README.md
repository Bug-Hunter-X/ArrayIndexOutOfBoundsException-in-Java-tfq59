This repository contains a Java program demonstrating a common runtime error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The bug.java file showcases the erroneous code, while bugSolution.java provides the corrected version.  Understanding this exception is crucial for writing robust Java applications.  The issue arises from attempting to access an array element using an index that is out of bounds (either negative or greater than or equal to the array's length).  The solution involves carefully checking array indices before accessing elements.
